# AWSRoadmap
I will update this Roadmap with all my work regarding AWS and my journey to a career in the Cloud. These are projects I make and projects for clients.


The first thing I did was: 
 Create an IAM user for your personal use. DONE
 Set up MFA for your root user, and turn off all root user API keys. DONE
 Set up Billing Alerts for anything over a few dollars. DONE
 Configure the AWS CLI for your user using API credentials. DONE
 Checkpoint: You can use the AWS CLI to interrogate information about your AWS account. DONE
